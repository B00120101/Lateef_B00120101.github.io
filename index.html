    This Website was made for the purpose to <mark>teach and inform people how to use different social media platforms and learn the differences</mark> between all the platforms in this generation.
</p>
    
<br>

<p>
    The platforms that I will be showing are the most popular platforms that <mark>Generation Z</mark> uses on a daily basis Thee platforms are used to communicate with their friends and family through images, words, and videos.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 Social Media can also be used as a business to spread information to the world so people can purchase or view advertisements to generate wealth online without leaving there home. Also, some humans are very talented so it helps people be discovered on the platforms without too much hassle.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    <mark>Don't get too excited!</mark>Everything in life has a catch so, in this case, social media can be very negative to people's lives in many ways mentally especially if you're showcasing your lifestyle to others. 
</p>
      
<br>

<p>
    Their many social media platforms but the platforms I will be showcasing are <mark>Snapchat,Twitter,Youtube,Facebook</mark> and <mark>Instagram</mark> with many <mark>Resources</mark> and <mark>Contacts</mark> to engage with.
